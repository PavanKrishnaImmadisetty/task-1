# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the initial stages of the Machine Learning pipeline: **Data Understanding and Exploration**. Using Python and the Pandas library, I performed a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset to identify patterns, data quality issues, and suitability for predictive modeling.

## Tasks Performed
1. **Data Loading & Inspection:** Loaded the dataset and inspected the structural layout (rows and columns).
2. **Feature Categorization:** Manually identified Numerical, Categorical, Ordinal, and Binary features.
3. **Statistical Profiling:** Leveraged `df.describe()` and `df.info()` for a statistical deep-dive.
4. **Distribution Analysis:** Analyzed unique values in categorical columns to understand data spread.
5. **ML Suitability:** Defined the target variable (`Survived`) and selected relevant input features.
6. **Data Quality Audit:** Identified missing values and checked for class imbalance in the target variable.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
